Developing Data Products  
Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch
==============================

This repository is intended for the final course project of the 'Developing Data Products' in Coursera by John Hopkins University.  The repository consists the four final project submission files:
- ui.R
- server.R
- ShinyApplication_ReproduciblePitch.Rpres
- UserGuide.html
- README.md 

The ui.R and server.R are the code which contains the final project shiny application named **XXXX**. On the other hand, ShinyApplication_ReproduciblePitch.Rpres is the supporting documentation with UserGuide.html as the embedded documentation in the shiny app to help users.  

Listed below are the final project submission links for the shiny application and RStudio presentation slides:

- Shiny Application is deployed on ShinyApps.io server at: [https://elvergara.shinyapps.io/BreastCancerTumor_Prediction/](https://elvergara.shinyapps.io/BreastCancerTumor_Prediction/)
- The RStudio presentation slides is published to RPubs at: [http://rpubs.com/enricomarcovergara/shinyapp_reppitch](http://rpubs.com/enricomarcovergara/shinyapp_reppitch)
